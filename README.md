Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs: 
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.


ANSWER : 

=> FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS : 

- A user can issue and return the book in the LIS.
- The system enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing.
- A user can search any books based on title, publication date, author, etc. and find their location in the LIS.
- Librarian can manage and add the books.
- The system should notify the user and librarian about the overdue books.
- The system calculates the fine for overdue books on their return.



=> NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS : 

- Performance :  The Server would be able to perform desired tasks in reasonable unit of time.
- Reliability : updating the database by synchronizing between database and application.
- Secuirity : Issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users of LIS only.
- Scalability : The system would be scalable to support extended number of users.
- Maintainability : The system would be easy to maintain and extend.


Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.


ANSWER :



=> Features : 


- The app allow tracking hearing status over time and can also be linked to decision-support resources that encourage users to act on hearing loss.
- The  approach is used considered on the distension vibration that notifies the user of incoming messages or calls in their mobile. 
- Aware of the usage of sign language as the hearing-impaired communication language, technology should be an aid for interpreting the language into easier understandable manner for people who could not understand sign language, thus to enable them to be able to communicate with  others  will  be  made  easier  if  proper  communication medium is available through mobile phones. This will also help in  overcoming  barriers  aced  by  hearing-impaired communicating with  hearing people.
- Audio is considered to be a less significance aspect of user since they are likely to  hear, but  using audio could be added  advantage when the application is focused for communication between the hearing-impaired and normal people-
-  Hearing-impaired might needs an application that  could attract  them and  one of  the criteria  is animation. Animation is an important aspect to be considered for hearing-impaired application (Adamo-Villani, 2007; Zhou et al., 2012). It will help the mind to relate graphic and it could enable the curiosity among these slow learners to utilize the application. While usage of text (captioning) on the other hand is important for  creating a  relationship between  the animation  and video would enable the learner to enjoy the learning process and make them engaged towards the application.
- Four main requirements that generally used in mobile development which are: 1) Consistent 2) Offline and online operations 3) Seamless connectivity 4) Multi-platform supports 5) Optimized power use and performance. 

=> Scope : 

- This mobile  application basically  assist  hearing-impaired  in many  ways  such  as  for learning, communication, teaching, religious and gaming.
- The feature of vibration in mobile app  could alert them easily  since the  hearing-impaired could  not hear the  sound that comes  from their mobiles.  The vibration mode was also used in different ways such as lesser, higher and pattern  mode.  This  vibration  mode  is  able  to  be  adjusted according  to the  level of  hearing loss problem  faced by  the user.



=> Non-functional apects : 

- Accessibility
- Affordability
- Advanced sensors
- Mobile application developed must be able to ensure prospect of a user, along with the limiation in mobile technology.
